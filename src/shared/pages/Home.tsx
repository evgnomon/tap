        We give you a free complete meal when you need it most and receive no
        meal unless a free complete one, when we need it most! You are just a
        single push away from a running function/building-block that scales for
        the latest user like the first and scales for the first user like the
        last. The infrastructure nodes, SQL tables, in memory clustered cache with replication, sharding, and
        nodes are handled by Zygote. There is no
        information stored in Zygote unless replicated and sharded!
        As the app developer you just use Https interfaces and provide Https interfaces.
        Therefore,
        as a developer you just take and make the next important building block
        without wasting a second! Make an initial push for your function in
        Zygote .Run, immediately get it up running. You pay a small fee in
        Bitcoin separate to resources you use. unless you want to take self-custody. You (are) welcome to fork
        Zygote .Run together with your functions and data, so run and maintain
        the same code at your own custody.
